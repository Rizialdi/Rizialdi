### Hi there 👋
I'm a software engineer with a unique blend of academic and professional experience. My journey in tech began after a deep dive into scientific research, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

- 🤖 Professionally, I've contributed to various projects, developing a knack for creating scalable APIs and intuitive UIs. I like architecturing and I'm most at home using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for back-end and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) for front-end development.
- ❤️ I love writing TypeScript, and building fun experiments on type-level.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skills in DevOps, guided by [Adrian](https://cantrill.io/)'s comprehensive courses, to integrate more robust practices into my work.
  
Eager to explore new opportunities and collaborate on innovative projects, I'm always open to connecting with like-minded professionals. 

Let's chat!

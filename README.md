### Hi there 👋
I'm a software engineer with a unique blend of academic and professional experience. My journey in tech began after a deep dive into scientific research, where I developed strong analytical and problem-solving skills.

- 🤖 Professionally, I've contributed to various projects, developing a knack for creating scalable APIs and intuitive UIs. I like architecturing and I'm most at home using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for back-end and [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) for front-end development.
- ❤️ I love writing TypeScript, and building fun experiments on type-level. I'm also a Golang enthusiast.
- 🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skills in DevOps, guided by [Adrian](https://cantrill.io/)'s comprehensive courses, to integrate more robust practices into my work.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help. Reach out to me [@rasselio-diack](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rasselio-diack/).
